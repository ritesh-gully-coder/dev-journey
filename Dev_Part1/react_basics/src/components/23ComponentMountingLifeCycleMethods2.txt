1)Constructor(props):->
>>>It is a special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
>>>constuctor is used for:->Constructor is perfect for initialzing state or binding the event handlers for class components.
>>>Do not cause side effects.Ex:HTTP Requests
>>>Please keep in mind to call a special function as super
>>>The component we have accessed this.props only after the initially call super has singing the props as an argument.
>>>constructor is only as where we expected to change or update state by directly overriting by this.state fields.

2)Static method:->
>>>constructor(props)--->static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
>>>When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time.
>>>Set the state
>>>Do not cause side effects.Ex:HTTP Methods.

3)rendewr method:->
>>>>>>constructor(props)--->static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)---->render()
>>>render method is only method is required method in a class component.
>>>We simply read props & state and return JSX.
>>>render function is pure function for element props and state, which should always render same ui.
>>>Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
>>>Since it is render method JSX that also conatains the other children components,write after parent render method.
Children component lifecycle methods are also executed.

>>>componentDidMount:->
>>>constructor(props)--->static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)---->render()--->componentDidMount()
>>>This method called only once in whole lifecycle of a given component,is invoked immediately after a component
   and all its children components ave been rendered to the DOM.
>>>this method is perfect place to cause side effects.
   Ex:interact with the DOM or perform y ajax calls to load data by making network requests.
