1)static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
>>>This is static method wichb receives props and state as parameter and has to return 
   either null or an object that represents the updated states of the component 
   this method is called every time a componentis rerendered.
>>>This method is used when the state depends on the props of the component
>>>Do not cause any side effects and get odd state from props 
>>>This method is one of the more rarely used methods of updating phase.

2)static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) --->shouldComponentUpdate(netProps,nextState)
>>>This method receives update props and updated state.
>>>The purpose of this method is clear from its name.
>>>It dictates if at all the component should rerender or not .
>>>By default all class components will rerender whenever the props they receive or thier state changes.
>>>This method can prevent default behaviour by returning false.
>>In this you compare the props nd state values with the next props and state values
  and return true or false to let know react wheather the component should update or not.
  So this method is basically for performance optimization.
>>>Do not cause any side effects .Ex:HTTP requests calling the setState method.

3)static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) --->shouldComponentUpdate(netProps,nextState)--->render()
>>>render method is only method is required method in a class component.
>>>We simply read props & state and return JSX.
>>>render function is pure function for element props and state, which should always render same ui.
>>>Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
>>>Since it is render method JSX that also conatains the other children components,write after parent render method.
Children component lifecycle methods are also executed.

4)static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) --->shouldComponentUpdate(netProps,nextState)--->render()--->getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState)
>>>This method accepts prev props and prev state values as parameter
   and is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected n the DOM.
>>>It is rarely used method 
>>>It capture some information from the DOM.
>>>This method will either return null or return a value.Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next ethod.

5)componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot)
>>>called fter the render is finished in the re-rendered cycles.
>>>Cause side effects.
