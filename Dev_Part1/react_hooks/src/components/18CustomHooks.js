//Hooks are reusable functions.

//When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components,
// we can extract that logic to a custom Hook.

//Custom Hooks start with "use". Example: useFetch.

//A custom hook also called other hooks if required.

//Why need?????
//To share logic to two or more components.
