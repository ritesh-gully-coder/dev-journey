//The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.

//It allows for custom state logic.

//If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.

//Syntax
//The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments.

//useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)

//The reducer function contains your custom state logic and the initial State can be a simple value but generally will contain an object.

//The useReducer Hook returns the current stateand a dispatch method.

//useReducer is a hook that is used for state management.
//It is alternative to useState.

//Then what is the difference b/w useReducer and useState.
//useReducer is more primitive hook compare to useState.

//Oaky good,but i have question in mind is that
//When should i user one over other.
//??????????????


//reduce vs useReducer
//>>>reduce in javascript:->
//1.array.reduce(reducer,initialValue)
//2.singleValue=reducer(accumulator,itemValue)
//3.reduce method returns a single value

//>>>useReducer in Raect:->
//1.useReducer(reducer,initialValue)
//2.newState=reducer(currentState,action)
//3.useReducer returns a pair of values.
//  [newState,dispatch]
